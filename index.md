# What I learned about git and what I still need to learn

- Mark down stuff is actually really cool! I always was curious when I would look at npm packages read me's how they got all the styling, hyperlinks, images etc. 

- As far as the basic Git, I feel like I understand pretty well. There are some functions that I would like to learn more about that I feel like still goes over my head like rebasing but I'm sure we'll get there!
